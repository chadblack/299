**Accommodations:** Qualified students with disabilities needing appropriate
academic adjustments should contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your
needs are met in a timely manner with appropriate documentation.

__Attendance:__ Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:**  Assignments must be turned in to the instructor or teaching
assistant at the end of class on the day they are due, unless otherwise
arranged by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted without **prior
arrangement**, for any reason. This includes technology problems.

**Plagiarism and Academic Honesty:** Plagiarism occurs when someone knowingly
or unknowingly presents another personâ€™s words or ideas as his or her own. Any
work turned in for this class must meet University standards for academic
honesty. Any students unsure about how to apply these rules are urged to
consult with me prior to turning in any written work. 

**Office Hours:** Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture, discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses. I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
