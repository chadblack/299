# About

The 20th century was an age of heroic aspirations in Latin America. It was
an age of both intensely humane and intensely horrendous acts, made in the
context of trying political, social, and economic structures. This class
will consider the history of Latin America as a region through a series of
case studies that intersected with the life and afterlife of Ernesto
Guevara de la Serna. More specifically, the life and after life of Che
will serve as a node of exploration to the many branches of Latin American
social, political, and economic histories that defined the region in the
20th Century. Thus, while this class is nominally about Che Guevara, and
his personal struggles, strengths, and foibles, it is really about much,
much, much more.

It is about moments of historical contingency and long term historical
processes. It is about domestic and international elites and
revolutionaries. Using the life and afterlife of Ernesto "Che" Guevara, we
will examine 20th-century Latin American history with an eye to the
question, "If, when, and how did armed revolution become a rational
response to Latin American reality?"

We will examine ideologies of economic development and revolutionary
action that helped define the region. We will look at specific moments
that intersected Ernesto Guevara's life, from Peronist Argentina to
Guatemala '54 to Cuba '59 to Bolivia '67, and his afterlife of hopeful
image and crass commodity. In order to do this, we will hone our skills as
historians, engaging difficult texts within the context of their making.
We will read a lot. That is, at its most quotidian, what historians do.

We will not only use the life and afterlife of Che Guevara as
a provocation for understanding the history of modern Latin America. We
will also use it as an introduction to the theory, methodology, and
practice of historical thinking.
